***Go-AST Interpreter in Prolog (SWI, golog)***

**BOOTSTRAP PHASE INSOFAR!**

**TACTICAL**:
	1. "Dual" metacircular Interpreter in both Go and [github.com/mndrix/golog].
	
	2. Interpreter is used on itself, term encoding will be tuned (along with my knowledge of Prolog, hopefully).
	
	3. Primary goal is to allow `aleph` to devise constraints and/or  to induce new predicate clauses.
	
	4. Standalone interpretation on SWI-Prolog achieved.
	
	5. Go-AST regeneration, from the altered predicates.
